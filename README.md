## Hi there 👋

## ✨ About me in 30 seconds ✨

I’m a Data Science expert and Machine Learning specialist with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights and intelligent solutions. I work with tools like Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib and SQL to build end-to-end data pipelines, predictive models, and AI-driven applications.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through:
 • 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
 • 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
 • 🧠 AI & Model Deployment
 • 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

I’m always learning, experimenting, and building — feel free to check out my repositories and connect if you’re interested in collaboration!
